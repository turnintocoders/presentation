					<h1>Turn into Coders</h1>
					<p>Is a serious full-stack web developer bootcamp</p>
					<p class="fragment">in JavaScript</p>
					<p class="fragment">based in Turin - Italy</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What do you mean by serious?</h2>
					<p>
						We believe that real learning should take a decent
						amount of time, we don't promise the moon
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>OK, what do you teach?</h2>
					<p>
						We'll work together in a highly collaborative manner
						through frontend development (with a splash of React),
						Node.JS, PostgreSQL
					</p>
					<p>
						You'll be able to build fully interactive responsive
						web applications, with users, a database, in a scalable
						fashion
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>How long it will take?</h2>
					<p>
						The bootcamp per-se is 8 weeks long, but we offer a
						4 weeks pre-bootcamp to work on prerequisites and we
						recommend you to stay for 4 more weeks afterwards to
						build your first serious project, with your team
					</p>
					<p>
						Then you'll be able to stay for 8 more weeks to start
						freelancing, job hunting or building your startup in a
						safe environment, with mentors to help when you get stuck
					</p>
					<p>
						Don't worry you will still get time to enjoy your stay
						in Italy.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Where?</h2>
					<p>
						We have a very nice room in Toolbox coworking, the best
						coworking space in Turin (I think!).
					</p>
					<p>
						Our neighbours are the local FabLab plus a good number
						of tech companies. Every week there are many events,
						techy and not so much
					</p>
				</section>
<section>
					<h2>Who are you?</h2>
					<p>
						The founder, Matteo Giaccone, is a computer engineer. 
						He founded WeLaika 7 years ago. 
						He now works for a British Company.
						He is investing in Turn into Coders to bring modernity to Italy.
						He knows everyone in Turin working with IT.
						
					</p>
					
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>How much?</h2>
					<p>
						The cost is â‚¬3000.
					</p>
					<p>
						Included in the cost are the pre-bootcamp, and the weeks
						following it
